    <p>The Qutub Minar is a towering landmark located in Delhi, India. It's one of the most famous and recognized monuments in the country. Here's a description:

        The Qutub Minar stands tall at a height of around 73 meters (240 feet), making it one of the tallest minarets in the world. Constructed mainly of red sandstone and marble, it showcases intricate carvings and inscriptions from the Quranic verses. The minaret is a symbol of Indo-Islamic architecture, blending both Persian and Indian influences seamlessly.
        
        Built-in the early 13th century, during the Delhi Sultanate period, the construction of the Qutub Minar was started by Qutb-ud-din Aibak and completed by his successors. It's believed to have been constructed to celebrate the victory of Muslim rule in Delhi and establish their dominance.
        
        The minaret is a five-story tower with a spiral staircase consisting of 379 steps leading to the topmost balcony, offering panoramic views of the surrounding area. Each level of the tower is adorned with intricately carved balconies and motifs, showcasing the architectural brilliance of its time.
        
        Adjacent to the Qutub Minar stands the Quwwat-ul-Islam Mosque, which was built using materials from demolished Hindu and Jain temples. The complex also houses other notable structures like the Iron Pillar of Delhi, known for its rust-resistant composition.
        
        Today, the Qutub Minar complex is a UNESCO World Heritage Site and a popular tourist destination, attracting visitors from all over the world who come to admire its historical significance and architectural splendor.</p>
