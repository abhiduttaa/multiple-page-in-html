        The Taj Mahal is an exquisite white marble mausoleum located in Agra, India. It's widely regarded as one of the most beautiful buildings in the world and is a UNESCO World Heritage Site. Here's a description:

        The Taj Mahal is a stunning masterpiece of Mughal architecture, renowned for its symmetrical beauty and intricate craftsmanship. It was commissioned in 1632 by Emperor Shah Jahan in memory of his beloved wife, Mumtaz Mahal, who died during childbirth.
        
        The mausoleum sits on the banks of the Yamuna River and is surrounded by lush gardens, reflecting pools, and ornamental trees. Its main structure is built entirely of white marble, which changes color depending on the sunlight, giving it a mesmerizing appearance.
        
        The central dome of the Taj Mahal reaches a height of around 73 meters (240 feet) and is surrounded by four smaller domes, creating a harmonious and balanced silhouette. The entire monument is adorned with intricate inlay work of precious and semi-precious stones, including intricate floral motifs, calligraphy, and geometric patterns.
        
        The interior of the Taj Mahal is equally breathtaking, with vaulted chambers containing the tombs of Shah Jahan and Mumtaz Mahal, adorned with delicate marble carvings and precious gemstones. The crypts are surrounded by an octagonal marble screen, intricately carved with floral designs.
        
        The Taj Mahal is particularly famous for its ethereal beauty at sunrise and sunset when the white marble reflects the changing colors of the sky, creating a magical ambiance. It's also a symbol of eternal love and has inspired countless poets, artists, and travelers from around the world.
        
        Today, the Taj Mahal stands as a testament to the enduring legacy of the Mughal Empire and continues to attract millions of visitors each year who come to marvel at its timeless beauty and architectural grandeur.
